## BSP (Board Support Package)

This folder contains all code and configuration that is specific to a particular hardware board.

Typical contents include:
- Pin mappings
- GPIO configuration
- Clock setup
- Power control signals
- Board identification and revision data

The BSP layer isolates hardware-specific details from the rest of the firmware.
Further design guidelines and architectural rules are documented in the extended version.
