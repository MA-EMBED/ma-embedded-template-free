Part of the Mark Agius Embedded Firmware Template

## System

This folder contains core system initialization and configuration code.

Typical contents include:
- Startup logic
- RTOS initialization
- System state setup
- Global configuration

The system layer prepares the firmware environment before application logic runs.
Further design guidelines and architectural rules are documented in the extended version.
