## Application Tasks

This folder contains the application logic of the firmware.

Typical contents include:
- Application state machines
- Product behavior logic
- Event handling
- Task definitions

The application layer defines how the product behaves and responds to events.
Further design guidelines and architectural rules are documented in the extended version.
