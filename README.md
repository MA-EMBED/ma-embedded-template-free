MA Embedded – Firmware Project Template (Free Edition)

A clean and organised project structure for embedded firmware development.
This template gives you the foundation for building scalable applications on ESP32 and other microcontrollers.

It includes:

A modular folder layout

Starter files for each layer

Naming conventions and layout principles

Clear separation between BSP, HAL, drivers, services, system and application logic

The goal of this template is simple:
help embedded engineers start new projects with clarity and a solid architecture instead of reinventing the structure every time.

This is the free version, focused on the structure and core philosophy.
For a full, production-ready version including working GPIO, UART, I2C, device drivers, tasks and board initialization, you can check the Pro Edition.
